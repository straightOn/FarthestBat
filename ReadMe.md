# idea
- bat needs food an hunts fireflys
- bat runs out of energy when flapping
- red fireflies substract energy, green and yellow add some
- can land on ground
- on ground a predator can attack you

# additions
- gravel point in tree (cheat)
- predator-count random depending on name
- additional bats flying for food
- zoom + spyglas shape for playing
- firefly groups spawn and despawn random after time
- special name will spawn ultimate amount of fireflys

# nice
- particles when eating
- particles when spawning fireflys
- fly-particles
- catch-particles (game-over)
