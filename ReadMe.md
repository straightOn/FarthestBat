## title
- Luminous Leaper

## idea
- bat needs food an hunts fireflys
- bat runs out of energy when flapping
- red fireflies substract energy, green and yellow add some
- can land on ground
- additional bats flying for food
- on ground a predator can attack you
- zoom + spyglas shape for playing
- firefly groups spawn and despawn random after time

## 2do:
- bugs
    - disabled input while transitioning between scenes
    - flickering stamina bar at low stamina on all bats regardless of stamina
    - flickering transition between scenes

## additions:
- shake-effect when collecting or getting caught
- replace world-glow with particles
- gravel point in tree (cheat)
